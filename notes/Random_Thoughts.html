      <p> The ASG licensed CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow CO2 NBB Non-Blowback Airsoft Pistol is a incredible new addition to the CO2 NBB family.  Non-Blowback airsoft guns are getting more popular due to their decreased costs, lighter weight, and markedly improved gas intake.  And it’s easy to see why.  The ASG Shadow SP-01 is a outstanding example.  It’s fully licensed by CZ (Ceská Zbrojovka) and includes its trademarks on this pistol.  It fires around 400 and 480 FPS with 0.20g BBs, and the magazine holds up to fifteen rounds.  The accessory rail positioned at the front of the CZ 75 CO2 NBB Pistol permits for the attachment of pistol lights and other pistol accessories </p>
